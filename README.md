P.S. All the codes are executed on Discovery's CPUs and GPUs.

Results & Analysis derived from the executions are as follows:

Images were pre-processing using following techniques:

Data Loading Parallelization is performed using Dask and Multiprocessing.Pool() functions. Other aspects considered were async Pool, async apply and more.

Data Modeling Parallelization results are accumulated via Serial executions on CPU, DDP (Distributed Data Processing on CPU) and DDP on GPU.
